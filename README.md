# Home-Credit-Default-Risk
I partecipated, on kaggle, to the following challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk; By datasets provided by challenge it was requested to develop a model who recognize the people would be able to pay the debt and people won't to be able. In order to complete this task I done a lot of effort on feature engineering merging all dataset and doing some task (e.g. missing value handling and other) on the columns, adding also some new column.
